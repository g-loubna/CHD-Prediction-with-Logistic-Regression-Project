# CHD-Prediction-with-Logistic-Regression-Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of having **Coronary Heart Disease aka CHD** using a Logistic Regression 
approach, the model used during the process was trained using **gradient descent** to minimize the **cost function**, 
and the purpose was to identify entities at high risk of CHD.
The repository goes through the full process from Data Analysis+preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Workflow 

1. **EDA (Exploration and Data Analysis)** :
   - Analyzing, Observing the high correlated features and handling missing values for smoother operation.
   - Creating multi-DataSets from the original to distinguish the impact of imputing by KNN, prediction missing values by classification.

2.  **Model Building** :
   
    - Implementing Gradient Descent and cost function from scratch.
    - Using logistic regression to predict A CHD individual.

3. **Model Evaluation** :
   
   - Evaluating the model by cost function, confusion matrix and accuracy.
   - Fine-Tuning Hyperparameters to improve our chosen evaluation metric.
